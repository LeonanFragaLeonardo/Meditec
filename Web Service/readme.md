This WebService was developed using the Netbeans IDE and Java EE.
There are two main packages (entities and services)
Entities are classes directly related to the database tables.
Services are the classes responsible for providing access to services.

Basically, the ClassDiagram file shows the structure of the entire service. (It may not be the ideal structure, but the idea of this project is to be as simple as possible)

Note: The use of security techniques in this service was not a crucial requirement because implementation had to be done in less than 1 day.

As future work, it is expected to use authentication, authorization and encryption mechanisms through tokens and AES-512. Maybe, even blockchains.
